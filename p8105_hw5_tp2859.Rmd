#Describe
The steep rise in power between μ=1 and μ=4 highlights the critical range where effect size plays a significant role in improving the test's ability to detect differences. When the true mean mu reaches higher values from 4 to 6.the power of the test approaches 1.0, meaning it almost always correctly rejects the mull hypothesis when it is false.

mean_estimate_data <- results %>%
  group_by(mu_true) %>%
  summarize(mean_mu_hat_all = mean(mu_hat),
            mean_mu_hat_rejected = mean(mu_hat[p_value < alpha]))

#Is the sample average of 𝜇̂ across tests for which the null is rejected approximately equal to the true value of 𝜇? Why or why not?

The average of 𝜇̂ for rejected tests is not approximately equal to the true value of μ for smaller μ due to selection bias, but it becomes approximately equal as μ increases and the null is rejected consistently. This highlights the importance of considering selection effects when interpreting results from subsets of data where a hypothesis test outcome is used as a filter.

```{r}
data <- read.csv("homicide-data.csv")
```

```{r}
homicide_data <- data %>%
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "))

#Summarize total and unsolved homicides by city_state
homicide_summary <- homicide_data %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(
    total_homicides = n(),
    unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"))
  )

#Calculate proportion of unsolved homicides for Baltimore, MD
baltimore_data <- filter(homicide_summary, city_state == "Baltimore, MD")
baltimore_test <- prop.test(baltimore_data$unsolved_homicides, baltimore_data$total_homicides)
baltimore_result <- tidy(baltimore_test)
```

```{r}
#Run prop.test for each city
city_tests <- homicide_summary %>%
  mutate(test_results = map2(unsolved_homicides, total_homicides, ~ prop.test(.x, .y))) %>%
